# UnicornOverlordTextFixes
A mod for Unicorn Overlord on Switch (& emulators) that fixes translation errors and typos.

This mod does ***not*** modify gameplay; it merely corrects the mistranslations and typos.

The current release is for Unicorn Overlord 1.04.

This mod was originally focused on fixed translation errors in skill descriptions, but patch 1.04 fixed those.
So now most of the fixes are for typos in rapport conversations.

### Installation
- On real Switch hardware, you must be jailbroken/modchipped with [Atmosphere](https://github.com/Atmosphere-NX/Atmosphere/releases) installed. Place Unicorn_US.CPK in the appropriate directory for RomFS replacement.
- On a Switch emulator, Place Unicorn_US.CPK in [the appropriate directory](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx/wiki/Ryujinx-Setup-&-Configuration-Guide#managing-mods) for RomFS replacement.
- What about PS4/5? I don't own a PS4/5, and I have no idea if modding games on them is even possible. Probably takes a jailbreak of some kind? In theory you'd figure out where Unicorn_US.CPK lives and replace it.

### Help Wanted

- Found another mistranslated skill description? Please report it by replying to [this issue](https://github.com/ChthonVII/UnicornOverlordTextFixes/issues/1).
- Do you speak fluent German, Spanish, French, or Italian? Do you know your way around a hex editor? Then please contribute fixes for those languages. See [HowToModUOText.md](HowToModUOText.md) in this repo for information on how to do that.
- Are you able to unpack the PS4/5 edition of the game? Please drop me a line. I'd really like to make a 4K mod for Switch (and its emulators).
